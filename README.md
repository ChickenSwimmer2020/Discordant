# Discordant
Nothing **stays** in harmony

# TODO:
- [ ] Make a frontent for controls from `UserPrefs.hx` via a layerable abstract over FlxKey. (ZSDev)
- [ ] Compress levels into a single file which is more sophisticated than zip. (ZSDev)
- [ ] Move level update loop from `PlayState.hx` to `Level.hx:LVL`
- [ ] Instead of sending the whole level to `Player.hx`s update, send the level in the constructor and reference that in the players update.
