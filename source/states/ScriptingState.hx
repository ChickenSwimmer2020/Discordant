 * we can use this for cool parts of the game where you have to write custom code,

 * where you have to write a custom script to actually hack the terminals and consoles
 * with a custom built scripting language kinda like hscript, but we make the user actually
 * do that on their file system itself so that we can break the 4th wall further.
