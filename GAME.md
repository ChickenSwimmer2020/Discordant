## mechanics

### TOP DOWN ISOMETRIC RPG SET IN SPACE WITH 2D SIDESCROLLING RYTHM BASED BATTLES ALL WITH FORTH WALL BREAKING PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR

* enemies have rythm based attackes. can switch betwen different styles of rythm
* player has to fight using guns. (TODO: find cool weapon designs)
* game looks isometric until inside a battle where style switches to 2D sidescrolling
* movement system like undertale/deltarune?

#### ideas

* fourth-wall breaking horror
* space based stuff
* vehicle sections?

game is a large time loop, the entire game is a nightmare had by the player character that when you win the game they wake up, if you play the game 5 times in a row and get the good ending all 5 times then,  the character realizes their in a timeloop, finds you inm their head, and kicks you out. ending the game entirely and the game deletes itself after the player kicks you out and the credits roll

##### game story?

* chapter 0: tutorial, where you learn how to use battle, how are we gonna show players these mechanics?

* chapter 1: underbelly of the ship
* chapter 2: cryobays (stolen idea from relocation failed)
* chapter 3: flooded areas? (TODO: change idea) [ship crashes onto a planet at the end of this chapter leading to the other chapters]
* chapter 4: off of the main path, caves (oxygen mechanic)
* chapter 5: back through the underbelly (oxygen mechanic)
* chapter 6: storage area (oxygen mechanic)
* chapter 7: medical bay (puzzle sections)
* chapter 8a: ship core is about to explode
* chapter 8b: vehicle driving section to escape the ship
* chapter 8c: drive the vehicle to an research base on the planet the ship crashed on
* chapter 9: research base, labs
* chapter 10: research base, underground true lab (biological manipulation (maybe elude to the final boss?)) [yes i stole the idea from undertale slightly, fight me.]
* chapter 11: Player loses control of the character and is now trying to stop them from escaping the game world
* chapter 12: final boss where the player is the final boss somehow, maybe we take control from the player and make the player act as the final boss, trying in-vain to kill the character they controlled (if the player succeeds they get the good ending, if they fail to kill the player they lose (HOW TF ARE WE GONNA DO MOTION CONTROLS))
