## mechanics

### TOP DOWN ISOMETRIC RPG SET IN SPACE WITH 2D SIDESCROLLING RYTHM BASED BATTLES ALL WITH FORTH WALL BREAKING PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR

* enemies have rythm based attackes. can switch betwen different styles of rythm
* player has to fight using guns. (TODO: find cool weapon designs)
* game looks isometric until inside a battle where style switches to 2D sidescrolling
* movement system like undertale/deltarune?

## ideas

* fourth-wall breaking horror
* space based stuff
* vehicle sections?
